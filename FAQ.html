            <h3><a href="#">How did you start the channel?</a></h3>

               <div class="inner">
                  <p>We started the channel by first surveying the scene, checking out lots of different reactors and seeing what we liked and disliked about certain channels and what aspects of those channels we wanted to apply to our own</p>

                  <p>Next we decided things like our channel name and logo, and started to create social medias and our discord and patreon sites. Then we began to decide what shows to react to! Once we decided we started to record videos and start saving them up. Eventually once we had a nice reserve we started releasing our content!</p>

            <h3><a href="#">What equipment do you use to record your videos?</a></h3>

               <div class="inner">
                  <p>We use a Blue Yeti Microphone to record our audio, a Pentax DSLR camera to record our video, and OBS software to screen capture what we are reacting to.</p>

                  <p>Eventually we hope to upgrade audio equipment get some lavalier microphones to provide better, more crisp audio to our viewers!</p>

            <h3><a href="#">How do you decide what content we react to?</a></h3>

               <div class="inner">
                  <p>We decide based off of a variety of factors! We take viewer suggestions in to account, we factor in shows we haven't seen before out of the classic hit shows throughout time, and we stay tuned for upcoming releases that everybody is excited for!</p>

               <div class="inner">
                  <p>Absolutely! You can always drop a suggestion in the youtube comments, participate in discord polls, or if you really want your suggestion to be prioritized, can suggest on patreon!</p>

         <h3><a href="#">How can I support the channel?</a></h3>

            <div class="inner">
               <p>One of the best ways to support us is through our patreon where you can gain access to early reactions, uncut videos, and more!</p>

               <p>If you would like to support the channel for free, you can help us out most by subscribing to our YouTube channel, liking and commenting on our videos, and helping our community grow by joining us on discord or other social media platforms!</p>

            <div class="inner">
               <p>We do all of our editing ourself! Eventually we may hire an editor, but as of now we have no reason not to take care of things ourselves, as most of it is quite simle in the grand scheme of editing!</p>

         <h3><a href="#">Do you pre-watch content or react blind?</a></h3>

            <div class="inner">
               <p>We try to keep the vast majority of content to stuff that we have not seen before to keep our reactions original and authentic, but would not be opposed to reaecting along to something we have already seen to provide deeper analysis if the viewers really seemed to want it</p>
