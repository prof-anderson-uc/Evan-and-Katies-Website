               I am a full time student at the University of Cincinnati, as well as a dishwasher and chef at an all American grille and am currently on the internship hunt! My favorite past time is playing games both digital and physical! I love playing games like Dominion and Magic the Gathering, as well as video games like Escape from Tarkov and Overwwatch! My favorite shows of all time are Game of Thrones, Fallout, and Arcane.

               I'm an aspiring content creator in all things lifestyle, girly stuff, and of course media! You can find me on most platforms! I love watching and analyzing movies and shows, and telling everyone I know all about them. My favorite movies are Pulp Fiction and the Princess Bride, and my favorite shows of all time, are Game of Thrones and Lost.

         <p>
            We are high school sweethearts who started dating in 2017! We started out as friends, but quickly grew into more! We moved in together two years later and got two kittens named Batman and Liam! Sadly, Batman passed away in January of 2025, but our Liam is still healthy and happy! We spend lots of time gaming and watching shows together, and love traveling and hanging out with friends!

      <h2>Why We Started the Channel</h2>
         <figure>
         <p>
            We decided to start the channel because we love watching other reactors, and share a passion for discussing our favorite shows! We realized that we spend so much time watching shows, and also independently content create, so we decided to put the two together and start creating reaction content ourselves! We figured it would be a great way to express our love for our favorite shows and create a community that can all discuss theories and thoughts together while also potentially making some opportunities for ourselves on the side!
